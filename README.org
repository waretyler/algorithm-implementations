#+TITLE: Learning blog: Algorithms

* About
  Producing something helps me learn, so I'm creating this "learning blog"
  essentially a collection of documents ("posts") that explain topics
  pertaining to this subject. In this case I'm looking at algorithms.
  Originally I had planned to implement them in multiple languages, but
  have since decided that that is a /bad/ idea. I'll implement 
  the algorithms in python - if I can't I'll use rust. Those choices
  are somewhat arbitrary (mostly they are languages I think there 
  is benefit in me knowing).

* Format
  I'm using the amazing [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] for emacs. If you haven't seen how
  awesome it is go [[https://youtu.be/SzA2YODtgK4][watch this]].
